  I love Chef of course, but not all members of my laboratory have enough knowledge about Chef unfortunately. So I had to write these automation script set ;-(
  
* How to use
  Just copy the scipt to each cluster node, and execute them.

  : for ip in {1..64}; do
  :   scp ./zabbix-agent.sh root@192.168.100.$ip:~
  :   ssh root@192.168.100.$ip /root/zabbix-agent.sh
  : done
